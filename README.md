# Parnell's Recipes

This repository contains all of the recipes I have either made or intend on making, categorized loosely (not by
directory). All of the files in this repository, save for this README, are in org-mode format.

If you use org-mode you will benefit from being able to use org's search features to search the keywords (which are not
present in GitHub's rendering of org files). In place of that I recommend grep.
